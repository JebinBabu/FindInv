# palindrome

Finds Inverted repeat pairs in a given fasta file.<br>
Python alternative* for EMBOSS palindrome.

*It is not as fast as EMBOSS since it is a python script and also I haven't used multiprocessing or multithreading for fast search. But it efficient for small sequence files and gap distances.
